#refactor in progress

reworking to support new mature typescript ecosystem.

#### problems running ```npm install```?

- [```node-gyp```](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) can have problems compiling sometimes.  make sure you follow it's install instructions (which are ***finally*** fairly clear/simple) 
  - if you still get compile errors, you might need to upgrade npm too:  either ```npm install -g npm``` or ```npm install -g npm@next```
